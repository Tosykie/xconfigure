# TensorFlow&trade; with LIBXSMM

There is a recipe available for [TensorFlow with LIBXSMM](https://libxsmm.readthedocs.io/tensorflow/) ([PDF](https://github.com/hfp/libxsmm/raw/master/documentation/tensorflow.pdf)). However, the recipe also contains information about building TensorFlow with Intel MKL and MKL-DNN (see section about [Performance Tuning](https://libxsmm.readthedocs.io/tensorflow/#performance-tuning-and-profiling)).

# TensorFlow Serving

For experimentation, there is a recipe available for [TensorFlow Serving with LIBXSMM](tfserving.md). Please note this recipe is likely outdated and not intended for production use.
